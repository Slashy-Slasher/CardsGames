# CardsGames
A series of card games designed to be used on desktop PCs.
When editing the files, it is important to note that there is no black jack class, there is instead a go fish class, the go fish game was not made and was replaced with black jack. We did not change the name to reflect this decision, so be vigilant when trying to change the go fish game which is really black jack.

BLACK JACK EXISTS NOW PEOPLE

TLDR: there is now black jack.
